Results
=======
A word will count only once per cell of a column. Counds reflect the prevalence
of that word across all cells in that column.

The results are NLTK's standard FreqDist object.


Usage
=====
For example, to get the word frequencies for the "Innovation Ideas" column in the
file data/ideas.csv:

  import csv_wordcount_analyzer
  from csv_wordcount_analyzer import Analyzer
  a = Analyzer('data/ideas.csv')
  freq = a.word_freq('Innovation Ideas')
  freq.items()
